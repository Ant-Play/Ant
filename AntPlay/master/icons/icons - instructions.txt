To create new icon:
-----------------------
1. Duplicate artboard.
2. Make your shape inside of "SHAPE STYLING" folder.
3. Create a SHADE shape which should compliment and/or match some geometric feature of your main shape, and somewhat indicate volume/depth.
4. Make your SHADE shape clipping to the "CLIP SHADE TO" folder.

5) You can check how your icon looks with tint by enabling and changing Color Overlay effect on the "SHAPE STYLING" folder.

Tinting can be used in engine to indicate activation state (for example).
